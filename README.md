SQL JOINS

In SQL, the JOIN operation is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. This allows you to retrieve data from multiple tables and create a new result set that includes information from both tables.
There are several types of JOIN operations, including:
INNER JOIN: Returns only the rows where there's a match in both tables' join condition. Rows without a match are excluded from the result.
LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all the rows from the left (or first) table and the matching rows from the right (or second) table. If there's no match, NULL values are used for columns from the right table.
RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all the rows from the right (or second) table and the matching rows from the left (or first) table. If there's no match, NULL values are used for columns from the left table.
FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows when there's a match in either the left or right table. If there's no match, NULL values are used for columns from the table without a match.
CROSS JOIN: Produces the Cartesian product of two tables, resulting in all possible combinations of rows. This type of join can be useful in certain scenarios, but it can also generate a large result set if not used carefully.
